# EAM-potential-using-LAMMPS
This a simulation of lithium melting carried out in LAMMPS a Molecular Dynamics software.  
The set pu is a two boxes, a section of solid and a section of liquid and the two box are put in contact to investigate the melting temperature of 
lithium-body centred and face centred structure. The aime of the simulation is to plot a melting curve. 

The simulation for this project utilises the EAM potential data trained by Nichol and Ackland through Machine Learning.
